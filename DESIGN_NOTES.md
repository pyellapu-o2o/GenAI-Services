## 🔧 Concrete Examples

### Workflow Orchestrator (Generic)

```python
# workflow-orchestrator/lambda_function.py
def execute_workflow(workflow_type: str, input_data: dict):
    """Generic workflow executor"""
    # 1. Load workflow definition
    workflow = load_workflow_definition(workflow_type)
    
    # 2. Execute steps in sequence
    for step in workflow['steps']:
        result = execute_step(step, input_data)
        
        # 3. Handle errors generically
        if result['status'] == 'error':
            handle_error(step, result, workflow['retry_policy'])
        
        # 4. Update state
        input_data.update(result['output'])
    
    # 5. Store execution history
    save_execution_history(workflow_type, input_data)
```

### Business Workflow (Specific)

```python
# business-workflows/fund-factsheet-video/steps.py
class ExtractFactsheetDataStep:
    """DOMAIN-SPECIFIC: How to extract fund data"""
    def execute(self, context):
        # Business-specific prompt
        prompt = """
        Extract from fund factsheet:
        - Monthly performance: X.XX%
        - YTD performance: X.XX%  
        - Sharpe ratio: X.X
        - Fund strategy: string
        - Risk level: Low/Medium/High
        """
        
        # Business-specific validation
        if not self._validate_fund_data(context['extracted_data']):
            raise BusinessValidationError("Invalid fund data structure")
```

-----

## 👥 Team Responsibilities

### Platform Team (Orchestrator)

```yaml
focus: 
  - Reliability: 99.99% uptime
  - Performance: Low latency execution
  - Scalability: Handle 1000+ concurrent workflows
  - Security: IAM roles, encryption, auditing
tech_stack:
  - AWS Step Functions
  - CloudWatch Metrics
  - X-Ray Tracing
  - Generic error handling
```

### Business Team (Workflows)

```yaml
focus:
  - Accuracy: Correct business logic
  - Compliance: Industry regulations
  - User Experience: Appropriate outputs
  - Business Value: Solving real problems
tech_stack:
  - Domain-specific prompts
  - Business validation rules
  - Industry terminology
  - Compliance requirements
```

-----

## 🔄 How They Work Together

### Execution Flow:

1.  **Business request:** "Create video from this fund factsheet"
2.  **Orchestrator:** Receives request, validates input
3.  **Orchestrator:** Loads `fund-factsheet-video` workflow definition
4.  **Orchestrator:** Executes Step 1 → Calls `extract_factsheet_data` lambda
5.  **Business logic:** Specific extraction rules run
6.  **Orchestrator:** Handles result, moves to Step 2
7.  Repeat until workflow completes or fails

### Configuration Example:

```json
// Orchestrator configuration (generic)
{
  "max_retries": 3,
  "timeout_seconds": 300,
  "retry_backoff": "exponential",
  "default_error_handler": "continue"
}

// Business workflow configuration (specific)
{
  "fund_factsheet_video": {
    "steps": [
      "extract_factsheet_data",
      "validate_extracted_data", 
      "generate_summary_script",
      "generate_summary_slide",
      "start_video_generation"
    ],
    "business_rules": {
      "required_fields": ["performance_data", "fund_strategy"],
      "compliance_checks": ["gdpr", "financial_regulations"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 💡 Why This Separation Matters

1.  **Independent Scaling**
      * **Orchestrator:** Scales with total workflow count
      * **Business logic:** Scales with specific workflow popularity
2.  **Different Change Cycles**
      * **Orchestrator:** Changes infrequently (platform updates)
      * **Business workflows:** Change frequently (business needs)
3.  **Separate Ownership**
      * **Platform team:** Owns reliability, performance, security
      * **Business teams:** Owns domain logic, accuracy, compliance
4.  **Testing Focus**
      * **Orchestrator:** Integration testing, load testing
      * **Business workflows:** Unit testing, business logic validation

-----

## 🚀 Practical Implementation

### Deployment Packages:

```bash
# Orchestrator package (infrastructure team)
package_workflow_orchestrator.sh
# Contains: state machine logic, generic error handling

# Business workflow package (business team)  
package_business_workflow.sh fund-factsheet-video
# Contains: domain steps, business rules, prompts
```

### Monitoring:

```bash
# Orchestrator metrics (platform team)
aws cloudwatch get-metric-data --metric-name OrchestratorExecutionTime

# Business metrics (business team)
aws cloudwatch get-metric-data --metric-name FundFactsheetSuccessRate
```

This separation creates a clean architecture where platform concerns are separated from business concerns, enabling both teams to move quickly without stepping on each other's toes.

## 🎯 Service Naming (llm-chat-service or llm-prompt-service or any other)

Based on the analysis provided, here are the recommendations for naming the service:

### **1. Analysis of Current Options**

* **llm-chat-service**: This name is too narrow as it implies the service is only for conversational chat. A broader scope is required.
* **llm-prompt-service**: A better name, but it still focuses only on the input (the prompt) rather than the overall process, which may include things like orchestration, state management, and provider routing.
* **ai-inference-service**: This name is accurate as it describes the core function of the service (making inferences), but it is very technical and might not be as clear to a broader audience.
* **model-inference-service**: This is a clear and accurate name, but the term "model" can be generic. It's also a bit verbose.

### **2. Recommendation: `llm-orchestration-service`**

The most recommended name is `llm-orchestration-service`.

#### **Why this name?**

* **Accurate**: The name precisely describes the service's role. It doesn't just send prompts or handle chat; it orchestrates the entire process, including routing requests, managing state, and potentially handling multiple providers.
* **Scalable**: This name is broad enough to cover current functionalities like chat and completion while also accommodating future capabilities and integrations with other LLM providers.
* **Professional**: It has an enterprise-grade feel that suggests a robust and well-defined service.
* **Clear**: The term "orchestration" clearly communicates to developers that the service manages the complexity of interacting with large language models, rather than just acting as a simple passthrough.

## 🎯 Key Differences: Dependency Management in a GenAI Platform

-----

### 1\. `genai-platform/requirements.txt` (Root Level)

  * **Purpose**: Shared dependencies across **all** services and the entire platform.
  * **Scope**: Global, platform-wide dependencies.
  * **Typical Content**:

<!-- end list -->

```txt
# Core framework and shared utilities
boto3>=1.28.0
PyPDF2>=3.0.0
python-magic>=0.4.27
Jinja2>=3.1.0
python-dateutil>=2.8.0
requests>=2.28.0

# Shared AI/ML dependencies (used by multiple services)
```

### 2\. `genai-platform/core-services/llm-orchestration-service/requirements.txt` (Service Level)

  * **Purpose**: Service-specific dependencies **only** for this particular Lambda function.
  * **Scope**: Specific to the LLM Orchestration Service.
  * **Typical Content**:

<!-- end list -->

```txt
# Service-specific dependencies only
# Note: Empty or minimal since most dependencies are in the shared layer

# This file might be empty or contain service-specific packages
# that aren't needed by other services
```

-----

## Why This Structure?

This dependency management strategy separates shared dependencies, which are installed in **Lambda Layers**, from service-specific dependencies, which are installed in individual Lambda packages.

### Real-world Example 💡

```txt
# genai-platform/requirements.txt (Shared Layer)
# These go into a shared Lambda Layer
boto3==1.28.5
PyPDF2==3.0.1
python-magic==0.4.27
Jinja2==3.1.2
requests==2.28.2
```

```txt
# genai-platform/core-services/llm-orchestration-service/requirements.txt (Service-specific)
# This service might need something very specific
# that other services don't need
special-ai-library==1.2.3  # Only used by this service
```

### Deployment Impact

Using a shared layer significantly reduces deployment size and cold start times.

  * **With Shared Layer**: Shared dependencies (5MB) + Service package (0.1MB) = **5.1MB** total per service.
  * **Without Shared Layer**: Each service package (5.1MB) × 5 services = **25.5MB** total.

-----

## Best Practices

  * For most services, the service-level `requirements.txt` file should be **empty or minimal**.
  * Use service-specific `requirements.txt` only for:
      * Dependencies not used by other services.
      * Different versions of a package needed by different services.
      * Experimental or temporary dependencies.

This approach minimizes deployment package size, reduces cold starts, and simplifies dependency management across your platform.
